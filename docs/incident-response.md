## Responding to Security Incidents

1. [Start the report process as per the TTS Handbook.](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/security-incidents/) Note that all incidents must be reported within one hour of their discovery.

1. Because Tock is hosted on cloud.gov, notify the cloud.gov team in #cloud-gov.

1. If the incident impacts the availability of the Tock app, notify the Tock team in #tock-dev. A member of the Tock team will then notify Tock users by posting in #tock.


If, as a member of the Tock dev team, you need to respond to an incident reported in #tock-dev, follow the additional steps outlined below.

1. Open an issue in GitHub to track the response to the incident. Label it "investigating."

1. Follow the [cloud.gov security response process](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/security-ir-checklist/), updating the GitHub issue as appropriate.
