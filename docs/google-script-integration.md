## Google Script Integration

[:arrow_left: Back to Tock Documentation](../docs)

Tock has several Google Scripts pulling data via API 
and offering tight integrations with Google Sheets for the operations team.

In particular, you should have been given an API key and granted access to 
`GSATETockLibrary` and `GSATEUtilitiesLibrary` as part of your [onboarding](../docs/onboarding.md).

Additional [Google App Scripts](https://github.com/18F/tock-gas-ts) are also available.
