# Joining the Tock team

## Onboarding

When you join the Tock team, you may be expected to complete the following
onboarding checklist on with minimal guidance. The Tock Product Owner may
schedule check-in time with you to ensure that you're progressing and aren't
stuck. If there is another Tock developer already on the project, you will be
assigned them as a buddy to help you progress through onboarding.
