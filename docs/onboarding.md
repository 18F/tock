# Joining the Tock team

[:arrow_left: Back to Tock Documentation](../docs)

## Onboarding

When you join the Tock team, the Tock system owner will guide you through the
onboarding checklist. The Tock product owner may schedule check-in time with you
to ensure that you're progressing and aren't stuck. If another Tock
developer is already on the project, you'll be paired with them so they can help you with onboarding-related tasks.

## Team member checklist
Before you get started onboarding, your Tock developer partner needs to take care of a few things.
They will [create a new issue](https://github.com/18f/tock/issues/new) with the following
checklist, work through it with you.
- [ ] Generate a Tock API authorization token in the admin for the new developer.
- [ ] Grant access to New Relic.
- [ ] Grant access to the GitHub repository.
- [ ] Grant access to SpaceDeveloper roles on Cloud.gov for `staging` and `prod` spaces within the  `gsa-18f-tock` org.
- [ ] Send invitation to #tock-dev in Slack.
- [ ] Grant access to `GSA_TE_TockLibrary` and `GSA_TE_UtilitiesLibrary` scripts.
- [ ] Grant access to `gsa-18f-tock` org on Snyk.


## New developer checklist
You will need to be sure you have:
- [ ] Familiarized yourself with the systems and scripts your onboarding partner has granted access to
- [ ] Reviewed the [Tock deployment process](https://github.com/18f/tock/tree/main/docs/deployment-process.md).


## Things to remember
- If you get questions about timecards that don't seem to be answerable from looking at the Tock code, it's probably the [Google Script Integration](../docs/google-script-integration.md).
