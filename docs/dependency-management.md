# Dependency management

## Python

Tock uses [Pipenv] to manage development and production dependencies.
In development and continuous integration the python environment is
established with `pipenv install --dev`. To accommodate third-party tools
which do not yet support [Pipenv] a `requirements.txt` file, containing
only production dependencies, is generated by [Pipenv] and included in
the repository.

Development and production dependencies can be updated locally with:
```sh
pipenv update --dev
pipenv lock --requirements > requirements.txt
```

## Javascript

Tock uses [npm] to manage javascript dependencies.

Dependencies can be updated locally with:
```sh
npm update 
```
