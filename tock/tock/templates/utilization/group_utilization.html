  <h2>Utilization by Unit</h2>
  <p>
    This report contains active billable 18F employees by their current business unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of hours submitted on
    projects that are marked "billable" in Tock, divided by the total number of
    hours submitted on all projects for the given period. Out-of-Office project lines
    are excluded from all calculations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the latest iteration in utilization reporting and an active <u>work
    in progress</u>. If an employee is missing, the numbers seem off, or you have any
    questions/concerns please don't hesitate to reach out in #tock-dev
  </p>
